Submitting Your App
When you have completed your app, please post it in a public repository and send us a
link - GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.
One last thing - as with all Agile development, we understand that everything might not
get completed in this first sprint. Please submit code that is ready for code review.
Focus on creating something you're proud of, and know that you won't be graded on
feature completeness.
